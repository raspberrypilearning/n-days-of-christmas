## Getting the text files.

In 'The Twelve Days of Christmas', the lyrics follow a general trend
of:

- Twelve nouns a-doing
- Eleven nouns a-doing
- Ten nouns a-doing

To create your program you're going to need a long list of nouns and a long list of verbs.

1.  Create a new directory called `n-days`, to save both the files in
2.  The **nouns.txt** file can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypilearning/n-days-of-christmas/master/code/nouns.txt)
3.  The **words.txt** file can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypilearning/n-days-of-christmas/master/code/words.txt)
