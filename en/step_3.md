## The N Days Of Christmas

We all love Christmas, and what we love the most is Christmas songs. Unfortunately, most Christmas songs just don't go on for long enough. Songs like 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' would be so much better if you they could be stretched out a little longer. How about 'The Fifty Days of Christmas', 'The Hundred Days of Christmas', or even 'The Thousand Days of Christmas'!

In this resource, you'll be creating a Python script to produce the lyrics to The N Days of Christmas where N is any number you want it to be. That way, when you go out carol singing, you only need to remember the lyrics to one, very long, song.
